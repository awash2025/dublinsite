        <p> When I strolled down Grafton Street, I was amazed by the vibrant atmosphere and the abundance of local shops like Zara, Sketchers, and even Disney! There were so many options for dining too, with a diverse range of restaurants to choose from. I decided to try out this cool donut place that had all sorts of delicious desserts. It was a fun experience exploring the bustling street and indulging in tasty treats amidst the lively surroundings.</p>

        <p> During my trip to the National Museum of Ireland, I got a glimpse into the intense history between Britain and Ireland. The museum was full of cool stuff, like buildings still showing bullet marks from the past. One thing I found really interesting was learning about the different soldiers involved in the conflict and why they fought. It was cool to see how people from different backgrounds had different reasons for being part of the conflict. Learning about this made me think more about how history shapes the world we live in today. </p>

        <p> The speaker provided insights into the concept of gamification, emphasizing that while play is not necessarily bound by rules or purely for fun, a game inherently has objectives and purpose. We discussed the essential components that make up a game, such as gameflow, which includes elements like concentration, challenge, player skills, and feedback. Additionally, the principles of gamification Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics were highlighted, providing a deeper understanding of how gamification functions. I found the lecture to be incredibly enlightening, offering a fresh perspective on design, whether in the context of games, web design, or user engagement.

        <p>It's evident that each nationality has undergone some form of immigration process, and the devastating impact of war has reverberated throughout history, causing numerous hardships. Additionally, discovering the significant Irish influence on various American presidents has been eye-opening and that 24 of American presidents have Irish roots including Barack Obama!  Considering the wealth of information gained and the insights into Irish culture, I believe it would be worthwhile to include this trip in our plans for next summer. The experience has been incredibly informative. </p>

    <p> Today, we  went on a trip to Glendough, and it was breathtaking! We got to see ancient landmarks that have been standing since the 6th century, which was mind-blowing. After spending some time there, we hopped back into the car and drove for about an hour to reach Kilkenny, a delightful little town in Ireland.
    Once we arrived in Kilkenny, we wasted no time and went straight to explore Kilkenny Castle. The tour was fascinating, learning about the history behind the castle and the area. It was a fantastic day filled with history and adventure!</p>

    <p>I visited Belfast and had an amazing time! My friends and I toured the entire city, which was fantastic but a bit cold due to being on the bus tour and the wind hitting us. We visited the Titanic Museum and learned a lot about the Titanic. My favorite part was being able to look up specific passengers who were on the ship. After that, we went to Victoria Square, where we wandered around and did some shopping. I also tried a place called Mr. Slim Chicken. </p>

    <time datetime="2024-05-13">May 13, 2024</time>
    <p> I found the National Disablilty Authority of Ireland's work incredibly inspiring. The NDA is dedicated to promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities and ensuring their full participation in society. They conduct research, provide policy advice, and develop practical tools to enhance accessibility and inclusion. It was enlightening to learn the different ways that the USA promotes accessibility vs Ireland and the on going debate on who does it better. This experience has deepened my understanding of disability rights and the importance of advocacy.</p>

    <p> One of the highlights for me was the stunning collection of fossils and geological artifacts. Seeing the ancient remnants of creatures that once roamed the earth was a humbling experience. The museum also features an impressive array of artifacts from Ireland's prehistoric times, including tools and jewelry, which provided a tangible connection to the past.</p>

    <p> Visiting Microsoft was such an inspiring experience that made me realize how close I am to achieving my goals. We had a fantastic tour with Victor and Linda, who were both fun and informative. They talked to us about the rapid expansion of AI and how many tech companies are seeking people skilled in AI usage</p>

    <p> Today's event was incredibly informative. We learned a lot about the political landscape in Ireland, including the history and details of the bankruptcy that occurred. The insights into these economic and political issues were enlightening. its very interesting how alot of the same issues happen world wide but how different cultures handle them. We walked around and seen the old facebook building and the area that Google now owns. </p>
