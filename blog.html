    <p> When I strolled down Grafton Street, I was amazed by the vibrant atmosphere and the abundance of local shops like Zara, Sketchers, and even Disney! There were so many options for dining too, with a diverse range of restaurants to choose from. I decided to try out this cool donut place that had all sorts of delicious desserts. It was a fun experience exploring the bustling street and indulging in tasty treats amidst the lively surroundings.</p>

        <p> During my trip to the National Museum of Ireland, I had the incredible opportunity to see fossils of extinct birds, rabbits, bugs, and sea creatures. It was like stepping back in time! The museum's vast collection included an array of fascinating specimens, each telling a unique story about life millions of years ago. The detailed displays and informative plaques provided captivating insights into how these creatures lived and adapted to their environments. Seeing the delicate structures of ancient birds, the intricate details of prehistoric bugs, and the remains of sea creatures was truly awe-inspiring. The museum also had interactive exhibits and engaging videos that made the whole experience both educational and fun. It,s amazing to think about how much history is preserved in these fossils. If you're a fan of natural history or just curious about the ancient past, this museum is definitely worth a visit! </p>

        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 09, 2024</time>
        <p> The speaker provided insights into the concept of gamification, emphasizing that while play is not necessarily bound by rules or purely for fun, a game inherently has objectives and purpose. We discussed the essential components that make up a game, such as gameflow, which includes elements like concentration, challenge, player skills, and feedback. Additionally, the principles of gamification Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics were highlighted, providing a deeper understanding of how gamification functions. I found the lecture to be incredibly enlightening, offering a fresh perspective on design, whether in the context of games, web design, or user engagement.

        <p>It's evident that each nationality has undergone some form of immigration process, and the devastating impact of war has reverberated throughout history, causing numerous hardships. Additionally, discovering the significant Irish influence on various American presidents has been eye-opening and that 24 of American presidents have Irish roots including Barack Obama!  Considering the wealth of information gained and the insights into Irish culture, I believe it would be worthwhile to include this trip in our plans for next summer. The experience has been incredibly informative. </p>

    <p> Today, we  went on a trip to Glendough, and it was breathtaking! We got to see ancient landmarks that have been standing since the 6th century, which was mind-blowing. After spending some time there, we hopped back into the car and drove for about an hour to reach Kilkenny, a delightful little town in Ireland.
    Once we arrived in Kilkenny, we wasted no time and went straight to explore Kilkenny Castle. The tour was fascinating, learning about the history behind the castle and the area. It was a fantastic day filled with history and adventure!</p>

    <p>I visited Belfast and had an amazing time! My friends and I toured the entire city, which was fantastic but a bit cold due to being on the bus tour and the wind hitting us. We visited the Titanic Museum and learned a lot about the Titanic. My favorite part was being able to look up specific passengers who were on the ship. After that, we went to Victoria Square, where we wandered around and did some shopping. I also tried a place called Mr. Slim Chicken. </p>

    <p> I found the National Disablilty Authority of Ireland's work incredibly inspiring. The NDA is dedicated to promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities and ensuring their full participation in society. They conduct research, provide policy advice, and develop practical tools to enhance accessibility and inclusion. It was enlightening to learn the different ways that the USA promotes accessibility vs Ireland and the on going debate on who does it better. This experience has deepened my understanding of disability rights and the importance of advocacy.</p>

The insights into these economic and political issues were enlightening. its very interesting how alot of the same issues happen world wide but how different cultures handle them.

They shared a lot of valuable information and tips for applying and interviewing at Google, which will be extremely helpful for our future career plans. We also learned about Google's flexible work environment, the numerous benefits they offer, and the fact that all their employees get free meals, which really highlights their commitment to employee well-being. Overall, it was a fantastic experience that left us motivated and excited about the possibilities at Google.

    <time datetime="2024-05-16">May 18-19, 2024</time>
    <p> Over the weekend, we took a mini trip to Galway and the Cliffs of Moher. Our visit to the Computer and Communications Museum of Ireland was so much fun. We explored the timeline of electronics, which was fascinating and nostalgic, seeing how far technology has come. Experiencing true Irish nightlife was a highlight as we enjoyed live performances and traditional music.

    The next day, we drove two hours to the Cliffs of Moher, where we witnessed breathtaking views of the North Atlantic Ocean and the historic farms affected by the famine. As we rode through the mountains, one of our instructors shared a poignant remark: "These are beautiful but unforgiving views, as they took the lives of one million people and caused starvation and emigration." This trip was both an educational and memorable experience. on he way to the cliffs we stopped to see the Dunguaire Castle. </p>

The exhibits really brought the past to life, showing us how this tragic period shaped the country. The museum's engaging displays and passionate guides made the history feel so real and relevant. It was a fascinating and moving experience that gave me a deeper understanding of Ireland's history and resilience. Plus, the cozy, intimate setting of the museum made it feel like we were getting a personal tour through time.
